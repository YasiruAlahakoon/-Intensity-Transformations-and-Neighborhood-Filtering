## Key Tasks and Results

### 1. Intensity Transformation
- Apply intensity transformation to modify pixel values.

### 2. Brain Image Enhancement
- Enhance white and gray matter in a brain proton density slice.

### 3. Gamma Correction
- Adjust the L* plane using gamma correction with varying Î³ values.

### 4. Vibrance Enhancement
- Increase vibrance by transforming the saturation plane.

### 5. Histogram Equalization
- Perform histogram equalization and compare before and after results.

### 6. Foreground Histogram Equalization
- Equalize only the foreground of the image using a binary mask, and combine with background

### 7. Sobel Filtering
- Compute image gradients using the Sobel operator.

### 8. Image Zooming
- Implement nearest-neighbor and bilinear interpolation for zooming.

### 9. GrabCut Segmentation
- Segment foreground and blur the background using GrabCut.
